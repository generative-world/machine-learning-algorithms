## Supervised Algorithms
**Supervised learning** involves training a model on labeled data, where each input is paired with the correct output. Below are the algorithms included in this category:

### Algorithms
- **[Linear Regression](./supervised_algorithms/linear_regression)**  
  Predict a continuous variable based on input features.
  
- **[Logistic Regression](./supervised_algorithms/logistic_regression)**  
  Predict categorical outcomes, such as binary classification.

- **[Decision Trees](./supervised_algorithms/decision_tree)**  
  Use tree-like structures for decision-making and prediction.

- **More to Come...**

## Unsupervised Algorithms
**Unsupervised learning** deals with data without labeled outputs, where the goal is to uncover hidden patterns or structures. Below are the algorithms included in this category:

### Algorithms
- **[K-Means Clustering](./unsupervised_algorithms/k_means_clustering)**  
  Group similar data points into clusters.

- **[Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](./unsupervised_algorithms/pca)**  
  Reduce the dimensionality of data while retaining most of the variance.

- **[Hierarchical Clustering](./unsupervised_algorithms/hierarchical_clustering)**  
  Create nested clusters using hierarchical methods.

- **More to Come...**
