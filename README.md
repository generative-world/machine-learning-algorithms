## Supervised Algorithms
Supervised learning involves training models on labeled datasets where inputs are paired with known outputs.

### Regression Algorithms
Regression algorithms are used for predicting continuous numerical values. Examples include predicting house prices, stock values, and temperatures.

#### Algorithms
- **[Linear Regression](./supervised_algorithms/regression/linear_regression)**  
  Predict a continuous variable based on input features.

- **[Polynomial Regression](./supervised_algorithms/regression/polynomial_regression)**  
  Extend linear regression by fitting a polynomial equation to the data.

- **[Support Vector Regression (SVR)](./supervised_algorithms/regression/svr)**  
  Use Support Vector Machines for regression tasks.

- **More to Come...**

### Classification Algorithms
Classification algorithms predict categorical outcomes, such as spam detection or disease diagnosis.

#### Algorithms
- **[Logistic Regression](./supervised_algorithms/classification/logistic_regression)**  
  Predict binary or multi-class outputs.

- **[Decision Trees](./supervised_algorithms/classification/decision_tree)**  
  Use a tree-like structure to classify data points.

- **[Random Forest](./supervised_algorithms/classification/random_forest)**  
  Combine multiple decision trees to improve accuracy.

- **[Support Vector Machines (SVM)](./supervised_algorithms/classification/svm)**  
  Classify data points using hyperplanes in high-dimensional space.

- **More to Come...**

## Unsupervised Algorithms
Unsupervised learning algorithms uncover patterns and structures in unlabeled data.

### Algorithms
- **[K-Means Clustering](./unsupervised_algorithms/k_means_clustering)**  
  Group similar data points into clusters.

- **[Principal Component Analysis (PCA)](./unsupervised_algorithms/pca)**  
  Reduce the dimensionality of data while retaining most of the variance.

- **[Hierarchical Clustering](./unsupervised_algorithms/hierarchical_clustering)**  
  Create nested clusters using hierarchical methods.
